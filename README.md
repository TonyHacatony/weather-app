# weather-app

This is a weather application. Weather for the current day + 2 days. The weather for the current day has a forecast (every 3 hours) with an hourly description. The search can be done by city name. Also, additional improvements have been made in the application:
- The layout was made for different screen resolutions.
- Added skeletal animation and notifications for better UX.

What new points I learned from this project.
- Work with 3rd parties APIs.
- CSS: ‘scss’, more media queries, mixins.
- More difficult ‘React’ project structure.
- A new way to build a project - ‘gatsby’.
